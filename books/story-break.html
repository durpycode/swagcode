    <h2>Chapter 1 - Poetry</h2> <br/>
    <p><b>At the beginning of each day, I think, I build, I spill and I am very skilled. Every day, everywhere, I repeatedly do the same thing, something, only one thing, absolutely nothing is coming. I keep on progressing and neck resting, every day, I'm in the mood to Improve, remove and then I groove. I'm expressing, pressing and guessing what to do next. I tried texting my friend, connecting to him. Why do you ask? Cause I need his feedback so I can lean back, so I can lack, attack and go back to working ASAP!!. Each birthday, for me It’s pizza day yay! What are we bringing? What are we doing? We enjoy the lovely, yummy, tasty good looking pizza. From where you ask? Pizza Hut!! The best pizza place in the world!! Oh-yeah baby!! It tastes good, smells good, so enjoy why you still can.</b></p> <br/>
