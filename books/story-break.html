    <h1>Story Break</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1 - Poetry</h2> <br/>
    <p><b>At the beginning of each day, I think, I build, I spill and I am very skilled. Every day, everywhere, I repeatedly do the same thing, something, only one thing, absolutely nothing is coming. I keep on progressing and neck resting, every day, I'm in the mood to Improve, remove and then I groove. I'm expressing, pressing and guessing what to do next. I tried texting my friend, connecting to him. Why do you ask? Cause I need his feedback so I can lean back, so I can lack, attack and go back to working ASAP!!. Each birthday, for me It’s pizza day yay! What are we bringing? What are we doing? We enjoy the lovely, yummy, tasty good looking pizza. From where you ask? Pizza Hut!! The best pizza place in the world!! Oh-yeah baby!! It tastes good, smells good, so enjoy why you still can.</b></p> <br/>

    <h2>Chapter 2 - The Wourout routine</h2>
    <p><b>At the dome, in the changing room, I get myself prepared for the gym. My coach a.k.a. Alex, the best, tells the whole class including me to just run around the dome. It sounds pretty simple, right? Welp at first yes but, once you reach half of the dome you get really exhausted as I always were.</b></p> <br/>
    <h2>Chapter 3 - Basketball (def. a sport)</h2>
    <p><b>Basketball. In my opinion, basketball is the best sport, it’s so simple, dimple because I’m a symbol, cause I’m Impulsed into It. Also, It’s my thing, I rarely practice but I still like it no matter what. :)</b></p> <br/>
    <h2>Chapter 4 - It's cold, but be prepared! (Feb. 03 2022)</h2>
    <p><b>Festivals in the winter season, it’s very cold. It’s even possible to get frostbite. What is frostbite?
